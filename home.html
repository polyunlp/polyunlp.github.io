            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Natural Language Processing Group at <a class="text-link" href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/" target="_blank">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a>!</p>
            <p>Our group is composed of enthusiastic and diverse members including students, postdocs, and research assistants and supervised by <a class="text-link" href="https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli" target="_blank">Prof. LI, Wenjie Maggie</a>. Together, we focus on developing algorithms that enable computers to process, generate, and comprehend human languages. Our research interests are wide-ranging and include topics such as Emotion-Driven Conversation, Goal-Driven Conversational Recommendation, Multi-Modal Conversational Question Answering, and Causality Mining and Reasoning in NLP, etc.</p>
